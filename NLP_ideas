Ideas to implement NLP into the survey:
- At the beginning of the survey, give two options: one to complete the entire survey manually (already implemented),
and one to provide verbal or written feedback before seeing any questions (main focus of the project).

- For option 2, the patients would have the option to talk for a limited amount of time (like 5 minutes) or enter a
limited amount of text (like 300 words) about their overall experience and any important things they would like to note
before the survey begins.
    - For the speech option, we would need to implement some speech recognition software to read the input. This would
    also be a useful tool for answering the questions in the survey verbally also.

- Once the audio/text input is submitted, we can use NLP software to analyze the input to pre-answer survey questions.
We can use sentiment analysis to determine how the patient felt about several aspects of their visit (e.g. how they felt
about the doctors/nurses/staff) so we don’t have to ask them these questions later in the survey
    - My thought is that this can make older people feel less like they’re taking a survey and more like they’re having
    a conversation about how it went

- For any comments they make that are non-question related, we can store them under the section that asks for additional
comments/concerns.
